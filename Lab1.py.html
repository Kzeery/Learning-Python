# ### Ming Ming Tan (instructor), Michael Liut, Trevor Ngo (TAs)
# ### Lab 1 Assigned Monday May 7, Due Monday 14 May 1pm
# ### Maximum grade: 26/22
# 
# The purpose of this lab is to:
# * Practice writing syntactically correct expressions in Python
# * Practice writing if statements
# * Practice writing `while` loops and `for` loops
# * Work with tuple, strings, lists, sets and dictionaries
# * Practice writing functions

# #### Question 1: Time Conversion 1 (2 points)
# 
# Write a Python function that computes number of minutes in the period of `d` days,  `h` hours, and `m` minutes.

# In[4]:


def minutes(d, h, m):
    total_time = (d*60*24) + (h*60) + m
    
    return total_time


# The following are some test cells which you can use to check if your code is producing the expected answer.

# In[5]:


minutes(0, 0, 5)==5
minutes(0, 1,0)==60
minutes(1, 0, 0)==1440


# #### Question 2: Time Conversion 2 (2 points)
# 
# Write a Python function that computes the number of days, hours, and minutes in a given number of minutes (essentially, do the opposite of question 1). 
# 
# Examples: 
# 
# `daysHoursMinutes(60)` should return `(0,1,0)`
# 
# `daysHoursMinutes(1440)` should return `(1,0,0)`

# In[18]:


def daysHoursMinutes(m):
    d = m//1440
    h = (m%1440)//60
    m = m - (d*1440) - (h*60) 
    
    
    return (d, h, m)


# Use the following two cells to check if your answer is correct:

# In[11]:


daysHoursMinutes(241) == (0, 4, 1)


# In[17]:


daysHoursMinutes(60) == (0, 1, 0)


# #### Question 3: Quadratic Formula (2 points)
# 
# The solutions to an equation of the form $$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ is: $$x_{1}, x_{2} = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$
# 
# <br> There are two solutions: one for adding, and one for subtracting the radical.
# <br> Write a program that takes a, b, and c as input and solves for $x_1$ and $x_2$.
# <br>You may assume that $ b^2 - 4ac \geq 0$. Let $x_1$ be the solution where you add the term under the square root term, and $x_2$ be the solution where you subtract the square root term.

# In[38]:


def quadratic(a, b, c):
    x1= (-b + (b**2 -4*a*c)**0.5)/(2*a)
    x2= (-b - (b**2 -4*a*c)**0.5)/(2*a)
    return (x1, x2)


# In[39]:


quadratic(1, 2, 1) == (-1.0, -1.0)


# In[40]:


quadratic(2, 5, -3) == (0.5, -3.0)


# #### Question 4a: Income Tax (1 points)
# 
# You are required to pay  a  certain  income tax  rate  depending  on  income  level.  
# The following table illustrates the rate: 
# 
# | Income     |   Rate |
# | :-------------:|:-----------------:| 
# |0-10000|15%|
# |10001-20000|20%|
# |20001-30000|30%|
# |>30000|40%|
# 
# For instance, if your income is $15000$, then the amount of tax you need to pay is $15000 * 0.20 = 3000.$
# 
# Write a function `tax()` that takes income (a number) as input and returns the corresponding tax. 

# In[46]:


def tax(a):
    if(a>=0 and a < 10001):
        return a * 0.15
    elif(a> 10000 and a< 20001):
        return a * 0.20
    elif(a> 20000 and a < 30001):
        return a * 0.30
    else:
        return a * 0.40
        


# In[47]:


tax(3000)==450


# In[48]:


tax(50000)==20000


# #### Question 4b: Pay (2 points)
# 
# Write a function `pay()` that takes inputs an hourly wage and the number of hours an employee worked in the last week
# 
# The function should compute and return the employee's pay. 
# 
# Overtime work should be paid in this way: Any hour beyond 40 but less than or equal 60 should be paid 1.5 times the regular hourly wage. Any hours beyond 60 should be paid at 2 times the regular hourly wage.
# 
# For instance:
# 
# pay(10,35) should return 350

# In[53]:


def pay(wage, hours):
    if(hours >40 and hours<=60):
        return (40 * wage) + ((hours - 40) * 1.5 * wage)
    elif(hours >60):
        return (40* wage) + (20* 1.5* wage) + (hours - 60) * (2 * wage)
        
    
    
    return wage * hours


# In[55]:


pay(10,45)==475


# In[54]:


pay(10,61)==720


# #### Question 5: Product (1 points)
# 
# Write a function `product()` that takes a list of numerical values as input, and returns the product of all numbers in the list. 
# For example, 
# 
# `product([2, 3, 4])` should return 24
# 
# `product([])` should return 1

# In[56]:


def product(array):
    a = 1
    for i in array:
        a *= i
    return a


# In[57]:


product([1,2,3])==6


# In[58]:


product([2,2,2,2])==16


# #### Question 6: Divisors (2 points)
# 
# Write a function `divisors()` that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the list of all positive divisors of n.
# 
# For example:
# 
# `divisors(1)` should return `[1]`
# 
# `divisors(11)` should return `[1,11]`

# In[66]:


def divisors(a):
    b = []
    for i in range(1, a+1):
        if(a%i == 0):
            b.append(i)
    return b


# In[67]:


divisors(56) == [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56]


# ### Question 7: Word Reversal (2 points)
# 
# Write a function `revWords()` that takes as argument a space-separated string with no punctuations and only the 26 ISO basic Latin characters. This function should reverse every single word and return the new sentence. Note: only each individual word is reversed.
# 
# For example:
# 
# `revWords("hello world")` should return `"olleh dlrow"`
# 
# `revWords("Ill make an offer he cant refuse")` should return `"llI ekam na reffo eh tnac esufer"`
# 
# 
# 

# In[124]:


def revWords(a):
    a = a[::-1]
    aWords = a.split(" ")
    aWords = aWords[-1::-1]
    output = ' '.join(aWords)
    print(output)
    return output
        


# In[125]:


revWords("hello dolly this is lois") == "olleh yllod siht si siol"


# In[126]:


revWords("tomorrow I love you tomorrow") == "worromot I evol uoy worromot"


# #### Question 8: Halved (1 points)
# 
# Write a function `halved()` that takes as input a positive integer $n$ and answers this question: How many times can $n$ be halved (using integer division) before reaching 1? This value should be returned. 
# 
# For example:
# 
# `halved(4)` should return 2
# 
# `halved(11)` should return 3

# In[132]:


def halved(a):
    i = 0
    while(a != 1):
        a = a//2
        i += 1
    return i


# In[133]:


halved(128)==7


# In[134]:


halved(9)==3


# #### Question 9: Palindromes (3 points)
# 
# A palindrome is a word x for which it holds x = rev(x); in other words, x is equal to itself when reversed.
# 
# Write a function `hasPalindrome(s)` which takes as input a string of character _numbers_ and returns the boolean value if a palindrome exists for that string combination of character numbers.
# 
# Hint: you may want to use the built-in `eval()` function. An important data structure that you learn this week will be of help with this problem.
# 
# `hasPalindrome("1231")` should return `False`
# 
# `hasPalindrome("12312")` should return `True`

# In[159]:


def hasPalindrome(a):
    i = 0
    if(len(a)%2 == 0):
        while(i<10):
            if(a.count(str(i))%2 == 0):
                 i += 1
            else:
                return False
    else:
        j = 0
        while(i<10):
            if(a.count(str(i))%2 == 0):
                 i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                j += 1
        if(j%2 == 0):
            return False
    return True


# In[160]:


hasPalindrome("23232244") == True
# ...because a possible palindrome is "22344322"


# ### Question 10a: University Majors (2 points)
# 
# Given a dictionary that tells you a person's major, write a Python function that, given a person's name and a major, returns `True` if that person is majoring in that subject, and `False` otherwise.

# In[194]:


def check_major(name, major, majors_dict):
    if(majors_dict.get(name) == major):
        return True
        
    return False


# In[195]:


majors_1 = {"Josh": "Engineering", "Carol": "Accounting", "Douglas": "Art History", "Irene": "Engineering", "Robert": "Engineering", "Christine": "Accounting", "Charles": "Accounting"}
check_major("Douglas", "Art History", majors_1) == True


# In[196]:


majors_1 = {"Josh": "Engineering", "Carol": "Accounting", "Douglas": "Art History", "Irene": "Engineering", "Robert": "Engineering", "Christine": "Accounting", "Charles": "Accounting"}
check_major("Josh", "Accounting", majors_1) == False


# ### Question 10b: University Majors II (2 points)
# 
# Given a dictionary that instead maps majors to lists of names, repeat the above question.

# In[139]:


def check_major2(name, major, major_dictionary):
    if(name in major_dictionary.get(major)):
        return True
    return False


# In[140]:


majors_2 = {"Engineering": ["Josh", "Robert", "Irene"], "Accounting": ["Carol", "Christine", "Charles"], "Art History": ["Douglas"]}
check_major2("Douglas", "Art History", majors_2) == True


# #### Bonus Question: Network (4 points)
# Let's assume that students who work together on the assignment are friends. We suppose that two students sharing a friend must be friends themselves: 
# If Student 0 is a friend of Student 1 and  Student 1 is a friend of Student 2, then Student 0 and Student 2 must be friends. Using this rule, we can partition the students into circles of friends. 
# 
# Implement a function `networks()` that takes two input arguments. The first is the number of $n$ students in the class. We assume students are identified using integers 0 through n-1. The second input argument is a list of tuple objects that define friendships. 
# For example, `(1,2)` indicates that Student 1 and Student 2 are friends. 
# 
# The function `networks()` should return a set of tuple objects that defines the circle of friends.
# 
# For example,
# 
# `networks(5, [(0,1),(1,2), (3,4)])` should return `{(0, 1, 2), (3, 4)}` <br>
# `networks(6, [(0,2), (1,2), (3,4), (4, 5)])` should return `{(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5)}`

# In[134]:


def networks(n, tupList):
    j = 0
    while(j<len(tupList)):
        i = j + 1
        while(i < len(tupList)):
            if((len(tuple(set(tupList[j]).intersection(set(tupList[i]))))) > 0):
                tupList[j]= tuple(set((tupList[j] + tupList[i])))
                del tupList[i]
            else:
                i += 1
        j += 1
        
    
    return set(tupList)
